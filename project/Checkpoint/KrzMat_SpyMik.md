### Team: Mateusz Krzyziński, Mikołaj Spytek
### Chosen project: C - Variational Deep Autoencoder (VaDE)

### Current progress
- We have read the paper about VaDE, familiarized ourselves with related works and other supporting materials.
- We have implemented VaDE in Pytorch in a way that allows the use of various training techniques, including pretraining from standard autoencoder. 
- We have also implemented VAE as a model for comparison.
