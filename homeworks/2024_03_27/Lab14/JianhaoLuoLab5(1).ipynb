This high p-value indicates that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis of conditional independence between XX and YY given ZZ. In other words, the test does not provide strong evidence against the notion that XX and YY are conditionally independent, despite the fact that we expected them to be conditionally dependent in this scenario.\n",

This result is significant at common significance levels (e.g., α=0.05α=0.05), suggesting that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis of conditional independence. This is an interesting outcome because it implies a detection of conditional dependency when, according to the scenario setup, XX and YY should be conditionally independent given ZZ. This could be due to the model capturing underlying patterns or noise in the data that falsely suggest dependency.\n",

Contrary to the asymptotic test, this very high p-value strongly suggests that there is no evidence against the null hypothesis of conditional independence in this scenario.

        "\n",
        "    The asymptotic test seems to have provided a counterintuitive result in the conditional independence scenario, detecting dependency where we expected none. This might be due to the sensitivity of the asymptotic test to the sample size, distribution characteristics, or specific patterns in the simulated data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    The permutation test results appear more aligned with expectations, especially in the conditional independence scenario, where it did not find evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
        "    In the conditional dependence scenario, it suggested a slight, albeit not strong, indication of dependency, which could be due to the inherent randomness and complexity of detecting conditional dependencies in discretized data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    These outcomes underscore the importance of using multiple testing approaches to assess conditional independence, as different tests may have varying sensitivities and specificities to the underlying data structures. They also highlight the complexities involved in statistical testing, where factors like sample size, distribution assumptions, and the method of discretization can significantly influence test outcomes."
