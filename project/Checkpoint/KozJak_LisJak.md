## Chosen project: Project A

Progress:
- we have familiarized ourselves with the papers suggested: [Brown et al](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/brown12a/brown12a.pdf), [Fleuret](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/fleuret04a/fleuret04a.pdf), [Shishkin et al](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/d5e2fbef30a4eb668a203060ec8e5eef-Paper.pdf)
- our initial selection of information theory based methods looks as follows:
  - JMI *Joint Mutual Information*
  - MRMR *Max-Relevance Min-Redundancy*
  - CMIM *Conditional Mutual Information Maximization*
- we are not 100% sure which arbitrary methods we will choose, but most probably we will leverage Boruta and Recursive Feature Elimination

The above description summarizes our initial ideas for the method selection. So far we have finished implementation of JMI and created the artificial example with known significant features.
