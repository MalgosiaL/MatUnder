# Mathematical Underpinnings

  - Please send me your github usernames so I can add you as collaborators to this project: malgorzata.lazecka.dokt at pw.edu.pl. If you don't have a gitHub account and are unwilling to sign up, please send your "homework" to my email.

Points:
  - After each class, upload your notebook to the appropriate folder (homeworks/date). Remember to name your file using the following convention: SurnameName.ipynb. If there is homework, the deadline will be before the next class. Each "homework" earns you 1 point. That will give approximately 10 points in total for "homeworks".
  - There will be one project during the semester, and the topics will be revealed in mid-March. You may choose to work on the project individually or in pairs. Additionally, there will be one checkpoint scheduled during the semester to monitor progress. The project is worth a total of 40 points.

10 (or more) points + 40 points = 50 (or more) points
