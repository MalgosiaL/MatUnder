Subject: Project C - Variational Deep Autoencoder (VaDE) 

So far, we have familiarized ourselves with the provided research paper and implemented VAE and VaDE. We tested our implementations on both MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets, yielding promising results. However, we are uncertain about the performance of our loss function and using weights from a pretrained autoencoder; although they seem to work, there may be room for improvement.
