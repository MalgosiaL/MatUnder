## MUML Checkpoint

**Selected Project:** Project A - Feature Selection   
**Team:** Szymon Szmajdzi≈Ñski  

I have familiarized myself with the topic and researched methods that could be implemented. The methods I've decided to implement are:

- (JMI) Joint Mutual Information - [Bennasar et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417415004674)
- (CMIM) Conditional Mutual Information Maximization - [Fleuret](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5177978)

Additionally, I plan to evaluate the following arbitrary methods:

- Random Forest Feature Importance
- Boruta

To evaluate these methods, I will use:

- Artificial datasets with varying numbers of significant and insignificant variables
- Real datasets from the UCI repository (specific dataset are not selected yet)
- An artificial dataset designed to challenge MI-based methods (still thinking about details)
