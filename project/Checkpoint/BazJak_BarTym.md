# Project C

**Group:** Jakub Bazyluk, Tymoteusz Barci≈Ñski

**Subject:** Variational Deep Autoencoder (VaDE)

**Progress:** We have familiarized ourselves with the method and implemented it. We started carrying out experiments on the dataset of time series data but encountered difficulties related to the imbalances of number of observations in each class. In the upcoming weeks we are planning to conclude our experiments on the time series data and conduct experiments on the MNIST dataset with the pretraining and parameters proposed in the article which introduced the method.
